# React Portflio

##Description:
In this project, I created a new portfolio for my projects that has elements from my original portfolio also featured on my GitHub profile. Unlike the other portfolio, this portfolio is made with react and is upgraded with more features such as email inputs, react bootstrap, and more of my recent projects. This portfolio will act as a means for me to show employers my projects and proficiencies in certain aspects of web development. This also provides a way for employers to contact me and see my resume and an about section about myself. This will also be where I add future projects. Each project in the project section features a description of the project and an image as well. This project allowed me to practice using  react and creating an app that updates with more optimization. This project allowed me to have a more holistic knowledge of creating a site from scratch with no guidance. I also now have a better understanding of how to use React Bootstrap and all the components.
